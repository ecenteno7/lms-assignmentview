### Application Description
This repository contains the source code for Blink: An LMS designed from the perspective of the student learning experience. 

### Repo Hierarchy
Source code is split into client and server code. The client directory contains frontend code and the server directory contains the backend code. The frontend code is linked to a Digital Ocean application service which only deploys from the frontend/layout branch. The backend code is deployed using a GitHub action to a Digitial Ocean workload (droplet).
